As you can see we have a sqlite database.


The server directory will have url routing to different apps
as well settings for our server.


The directory KeriSite will hold everything that we need to make
the website. It has html files, database models, static files
functions to run when going to a new url and others as well. A 
README in there will explain more.


Before you run the server run command 'pip install virtualenv'. 
After it installs run 'virtualenv -p python3 venv'. To activate 
the virtual environment run 'source venv/bin/activate'. Then you'll
want to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
and you should be able to start the server. To start it run
'python manage.py runserver' and then in your browser go to
localhost:8000 and you should see the default page I made.
