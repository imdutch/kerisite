The only files that we really need to worry about are views.py,
models.py, urls.py and the template directory. The file views.py
is where we have functions to run before we get information and 
display it to the user. File urls.py will be in charge of specifying
what functions we run once we get into a new url, makes sense. 
Models.py will hold our database records in a friendly python 
manageble class. If you add a new model to that file you will 
need to migrate it to the database, it's easy enough just google it,
it'll be like 2 commands. The templates directory will hold all
of our html files.
