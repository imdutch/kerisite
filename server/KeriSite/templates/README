Django's template tags are really nice to work with, instead of 
having to setup all the boilerplate lines in every file, we 
instead do it once and extend all of our html files with it. Things
like navbars can also go in there if they will be on all pages.
Each page has to blocks that can be used, block body and block 
scripts, which do exactly what they describe.
